## Capstone Project
The goal of this project is the implementation, in Python, of ROS nodes belonging to the SW for an autonomus vehicle, responsible of driving it through either a simulated or real environment. One of the node will include a classifier for traffic lights, and the SW will stop the vehicle in case of a red one.

First of all, the following picture shows a system architecture diagram detailing the ROS nodes and topics used in the project:
